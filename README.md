TerrainRouteProfiler
====================

Notes
------

This is an old project of mine that I created to help my dad route his
paths for a project he was working on.  I will try and clean it up as it
offers some potentially useful tools for manipulating GIS data.

Overview
---------

This is already done by Google Earth, so be aware that it is not that useful in
terms of standalone use.  This will take a list of points in a KML file or
manually added and generate the terrain model.  Currently, I support the 
Digital Terrain Elevation Model (DTED) which is a DOD spec.  SRTM is not
much different, as well as you can probably query using Google Maps.
